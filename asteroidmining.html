    <h1>ASTEROID MINING</h1>
    <h2>What is asteroid mining?</h2>
    <p>Asteroid mining is the exploitation of raw materials from asteroids and other minor planets, including near-Earth objects. Minerals can be mined from an asteroid or spent comet, then used in space for construction materials or taken back to Earth. These include gold, iridium, silver, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium and tungsten for transport back to Earth; iron, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, aluminium, and titanium for construction.</p>
    <h2>Our plan</h2>
    <p>There are over 16,000 near-Earth asteroids that share a similar orbit to Earth. Asteroids contain the resources that make it possible to fuel and sustain life in space, creating a new paradigm of travel and human presence in space and mining asteroids. There are an estimated two trillion tonnes of water available on near-Earth asteroids. This water can be used to sustain human life and as propellant for spacecraft. Through an extensive multi-year observational prospecting program, we has selected the most promising, resource-rich asteroid targets for the company’s first exploration mission. More accessible than the Moon, near-Earth asteroids are comprised of natural resources that will accelerate humanity’s exploration and development of deep space.</p>
    <h2>$700 quintillion</h2>
    <p>A single, 500-metre diameter asteroid contains more platinum than has ever been mined in the history of the Earth. There are over 2 million of these space rocks orbiting in the Asteroid Belt too, with an estimated billion dollars’ worth of platinum in each one. Including the gold, iron, nickel, water and other valuable elements that can be found there, NASA has estimated the mineral wealth of the entire Asteroid Belt could be as much as $700 quintillion, or a seven followed by 20 zero. That’s $100 billion for every one of the 7 billion people on Earth!</p>
